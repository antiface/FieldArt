WORKSPACE
=========
*Workspace as 3D Material Memory or Analog Database: "The Geological Method; Geo-Grammar or Geo-Grammatical Forms"*
* __*The Geological Method*__: Similar to Michel Foucault's __*Archaeology of Knowledge*__ except it's a __*Geology of Knowledge*__;
* *3D Surfaces + "The Art Operator as Land Surveyor"*;
* *Crackland & The Crackland Journals*: __*"Crackland: Land of Fissures"*__

* __*The Geological Method*__ came about after I was reading a lot of Michel Foucault, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Sigmund Freud (I know, kind of a strange mix!);
* I began seeing three methods: *The Genealogical Method*, *The Archaeological Method*, and now my own twist, *The Geological Method*;
* These were kind of like *Metaphors for Thinking*, or for *Historical Research*;
* My *Geological Method* would treat the phenomenal world as though it were made up of *sedimentary layers*;
* I only realized later that the *True Geology* was the geology of my __*WORKSPACE*__;
* It's not that I'm a messy person, it's just my research and art methodology;
* When I'm in the studio or research lab, I *manipulate stacks* of things, stacks of books, folders and papers, stacks of index cards and paintings and whatnot;
* As I work, I organize and re-organize things, and slowly over time *stacks/piles* build up by a natural process of __*ACCRETION*__;
* I manipulate these *Stacks & Their Substacks* as though I were a *Geologist*;
* In the 2001-2004 period, I came up with a concept I called __*CRACKLAND: THE LAND OF FISSURES*__;
* It had nothing to do with the *drug* and everything to do with an imaginary *Abstract Landscape*, a land made up of *floating land-masses / land-fragments called* *__CRACKLAND__*;
* I realize now more than ever that this __*Geo-Grammar*__ I called it, or these __*Geo-Grammatical Forms*__, were really inspired by my own __*WORKSPACE*__ and __*work methodologies*__;

> "Surveying or land surveying is the technique, profession, art, and science of determining the terrestrial two-dimensional or three-dimensional positions of points and the distances and angles
> between them. A land surveying professional is called a land surveyor. These points are usually on the surface of the Earth, and they are often used to establish maps and boundaries for

* __*The Geological Method*__ is a form of mental projection, *a projection of the Mind onto one's inward space*;
* That's where many of my *Concepts* come from in my novel-writing, which I call *novelistic phenomenology*, a type of writing that includes a form of metafiction that is a *phenomenology of the novel, or of the novel-writing itself, i.e. "the novel as it appears in the mind of the author"*;
* For each new novel, I basically come up with its own *physical cosmology*; that is, I create unique __*UNIVERSES*__;
* __*CRACKLAND: THE LAND OF FISSURES*__ was merely one of many unique *worlds* that I created in the novel called __*The History-Project*__;
* Other worlds in that novel were __*St-Elsewhere*__ (*"Montreal is an Elsewhere"*) and __*The Dream Assembly*__;

> "A fracture is any separation in a geologic formation, such as a joint or a fault that divides the rock into two or more pieces. A fracture will sometimes form a deep fissure or crevice in
> the rock. Fractures are commonly caused by stress exceeding the rock strength, causing the rock to lose cohesion along its weakest plane." - Ref. [Fracture (Geology)  -  Wikipedia]
