*Workspace as 3D Material Memory or Analog Database: "The Geological Method; Geo-Grammar or Geo-Grammatical Forms"*
* __*The Geological Method*__: Similar to Michel Foucault's __*Archaeology of Knowledge*__ except it's a __*Geology of Knowledge*__;

* __*The Geological Method*__ came about after I was reading a lot of Michel Foucault, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Sigmund Freud (I know, kind of a strange mix!);
* I began seeing three methods: *The Genealogical Method*, *The Archaeological Method*, and now my own twist, *The Geological Method*;
* These were kind of like *Metaphors for Thinking*, or for *Historical Research*;
* My *Geological Method* would treat the phenomenal world as though it were made up of *sedimentary layers, made up of geo-grammatical forms*;
* I only realized later that the *True Geology* was the geology of my __*WORKSPACE*__;
* It's not that I'm a messy person, it's just my research and art methodology;
* When I'm in the studio or research lab, I *manipulate stacks* of things, stacks of books, folders and papers, stacks of index cards and paintings and whatnot;
* As I work, I organize and re-organize things, and slowly over time *stacks/piles* build up by a natural process of __*ACCRETION*__;
* I manipulate these *Stacks & Their Substacks* as though I were a *Geologist*;
* In the 2001-2004 period, I came up with a concept I called __*CRACKLAND: THE LAND OF FISSURES*__;
* It had nothing to do with the *drug* and everything to do with an imaginary *Abstract Landscape*, a land made up of *floating land-masses / land-fragments called* *__CRACKLAND__*;
* I realize now more than ever that this __*Geo-Grammar*__ I called it, or these __*Geo-Grammatical Forms*__, were really inspired by my own __*WORKSPACE*__ and __*work methodologies*__;

* __*The Geological Method*__ is a form of mental projection, *a projection of the Mind onto one's inward space*;
* That's where many of my *Concepts* come from in my novel-writing, which I call *novelistic phenomenology*, a type of writing that includes a form of metafiction that is a *phenomenology of the novel, or of the novel-writing itself, i.e. "the novel as it appears in the mind of the author"*;
* For each new novel, I basically come up with its own *physical cosmology*; that is, I create unique __*UNIVERSES*__;
* __*CRACKLAND: THE LAND OF FISSURES*__ was merely one of many unique *worlds* that I created in the novel called __*The History-Project*__;
* Other worlds in that novel were __*St-Elsewhere*__ (*"Montreal is an Elsewhere"*) and __*The Dream Assembly*__;

* *Immediately after birth, the child begins contemplating his universe, groping around his biological center towards a greater and greater area or periphery around that center.  This is how the child learns the geo-grammar of his surroundings, that is, the geological grammar of the space that surrounds him, with its sedimentary layers.  The child will develop according to its genetic baggage which we call "genosense" and the particular history of its infancy.  Soon the child will learn to represent events to itself through self-narration and the beginning of the end has been engaged.  Man can deny where he comes from but he can’t escape the deterministic force of the history of his development*;
* *It is important, firstly, to grasp the true nature of the narrative.  The personality, as we see it, is a historical system.  On top of that, it is a subjective historical system.  The system orders itself, organizes itself around themes that are chosen by the individual.  At the age when a child begins socializing, a main narrative picture is chosen: i.e. I want to be seen as x, y or z.  Peak events are chosen and fitted into the main story.  The personality itself is this subjective historical system that projects itself in narrative form to the Other or to itself, giving meaning to itself.  This has a survival function: To strengthen the social group, to know what X is experiencing, to cut out the possibility of a threat, by means of seeking security*;
* *The personality is a self-reflexive system of representation.  This is what makes it historical.  It is subjective because it self-presents, or presents itself to itself and to the Other.  At a certain age, a choice is made, the choice of autonomy, the choice that makes me an independent geological fragment or plate.  The very nature of the subjective experience is “relatable”.  We seek companionship to be able to tell our stories, our narratives.  But there is such a thing as narrative failure, when everyone is so caught up with their own stories that listening does not take place.  Then the self can become alienated or disillusioned.  A sort of bankruptcy of the personality or subjective historical system takes place.  Social stigma can also cause this disenfranchisement, this slow dehumanization*;

* *Fictional Realms/Worlds in my Novelistic Phenomenology are Mental (Spiritual) Projections Onto the Inward Plane of (my) Being*;
