* __*The Geological Method*__ came about after I was reading a lot of Michel Foucault, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Sigmund Freud (I know, kind of a strange mix!);
* I began seeing three methods: *The Genealogical Method*, *The Archaeological Method*, and now my own twist, *The Geological Method*;
* These were kind of like *Metaphors for Thinking*, or for *Historical Research*;
* My *Geological Method* would treat the phenomenal world as though it were made up of *sedimentary layers*;
* I only realized later that the *True Geology* was the geology of my __*WORKSPACE*__;
* It's not that I'm a messy person, it's just my research and art methodology;
* When I'm in the studio or research lab, I *manipulate stacks* of things, stacks of books, folders and papers, stacks of index cards and paintings and whatnot;
* As I work, I organize and re-organize things, and slowly over time *stacks/piles* build up by a natural process of __*ACCRETION*__;
* I manipulate these *Stacks & Their Substacks* as though I were a *Geologist*;
* In the 2001-2004 period, I came up with a concept I called __*CRACKLAND: THE LAND OF FISSURES*__;
* It had nothing to do with the *drug* and everything to do with an imaginary *Abstract Landscape*, a land made up of *floating land-masses / land-fragments called* *__CRACKLAND__*;
* I realize now more than ever that this __*Geo-Grammar*__ I called it, or these __*Geo-Grammatical Forms*__, were really inspired by my own __*WORKSPACE*__ and __*work methodologies*__;
